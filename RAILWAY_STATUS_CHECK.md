# Railway Deployment Status Check

## How to Check Your Railway Deployment

### 1. Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Login to your account
3. Click on your Byootify project
4. Check the **Deployments** tab for status

### 2. Deployment Status Indicators
**✅ Successful Deployment:**
- Status shows "SUCCESS" or "ACTIVE"
- Build logs show "Build completed successfully"
- You'll see a live URL (e.g., `yourapp.railway.app`)

**❌ Failed Deployment:**
- Status shows "FAILED" or "CRASHED"
- Build logs show error messages
- No live URL available

### 3. Common Railway URLs
Your Byootify app will be available at:
- `https://[project-name].railway.app`
- Or custom domain if configured

### 4. Health Check Endpoint
Once deployed, test these URLs:
- `https://yourapp.railway.app/` (main site)
- `https://yourapp.railway.app/api/health` (health check)

### 5. Build Logs to Check
Look for these success indicators:
```
✅ Dependencies installed successfully
✅ Build completed successfully  
✅ Database connected
✅ Server started on port 3000
✅ Deployment successful
```

### 6. Troubleshooting Failed Deployments

**If build fails:**
- Check build logs for specific errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is provided

**If assets still missing:**
- Re-download the latest `byootify-clean-export.tar.gz`
- Verify assets are in `client/src/assets/` folder
- Check import paths use `@/assets/` format

## What to Share
If you're having issues, please share:
1. Railway deployment status (SUCCESS/FAILED)
2. Any error messages from build logs
3. The live URL (if deployment succeeded)

This will help me provide specific troubleshooting assistance.
