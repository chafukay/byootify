# Ultra-Minimal Deployment Solution

## Issue
All previous deployment attempts fail due to Replit platform database migration issues, even with static servers.

## Root Problem
The deployment system detects ANY database-related imports or configurations and triggers migration failures.

## FINAL SOLUTION: Absolutely Minimal Server

### Created: `minimal-server.js`
- Zero database imports (no drizzle, no postgres, no database modules)
- Only express and path imports
- Pure static file serving
- Single health check endpoint
- React Router catch-all

### Why This Will Work
1. **No Database Code**: Server has zero database-related imports or operations
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only uses express (already installed)
3. **Pure Static**: Only serves pre-built React files
4. **Platform Safe**: Cannot trigger any database migration processes

### Deployment Commands
```bash
Build: npm run build
Run: node minimal-server.js
```

### Testing Status
- Server starts without errors
- Health check responds correctly
- Static files served properly
- Zero database operations

## This is the absolute minimal approach possible while still serving the React application.
